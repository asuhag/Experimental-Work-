# Experimental-Work

Dear Tech Nation,

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate that I have participated in continuous learning by experimenting with new python packages. These programs are not executable since the associated data set is under an NDA and therefore redacted. Please note, this repository contains only a few examples because the bulk of my projects are currently a property of NETL and therefore a part of the internal, private repository.
